# DLHub Examples

Examples showing how to use the [Data and Learning Hub for Science (DLHub)](https://www.dlhub.org)

## [1 - Introduction](./1-Introduction)
These notebooks show the base functionality of DLHub: e.g., how to create a DLHub client, how to authenticate, how to invoke a servable, etc.)

## [2 - General](./2-General)
These notebooks include implementations of various model architectures against common benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, MNIST)

## [3 - Materials Science](./3-Materials%20Science)
These notebooks show DLHub models applied to problems in materials science

# Contributions
To contribute examples, depsosit your model in DLHub ([See how](https://github.com/DLHub-Argonne/dlhub_sdk)) and issue a pull request to this repository with the corresponding example notebook

## Installation
```bash
pip install dlhub_sdk
```

## Project Support
This material is based upon work supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from Argonne National Laboratory, provided by the Director, Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.
